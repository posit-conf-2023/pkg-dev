## Overview

We are often faced with the need to share our code with others, or find ourselves writing similar code over and over again across different projects.
In R, the fundamental unit of reusable and shareable code is a package, containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data.
This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of package development in R, using tools and principles developed and used extensively by the tidyverse team - specifically the 'devtools' family of packages including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2.
These packages and workflows help you focus on the contents of your package rather than the minutiae of package structure.

You will learn the structure of a package, how to organize your code, and workflows to help you develop your package iteratively.
You will learn how to write good documentation so that users can learn how to use your package, and how to use automated testing to ensure it is functioning the way you expect it to, now and into the future.
You will also learn how to check your package for common problems, and how to distribute your package for others to use.

This will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will be using the RStudio IDE to work through the materials, as it has been designed to work well with the development practices we will be featuring.

*This workshop is for you if you...*

1.  have written several R scripts and find yourself wondering how to reuse or share the code you've written.
2.  know how to write functions in R.
3.  are looking for a way to take the next step in your R programming journey.

## Prework

Please ensure you have completed the steps in [System Setup](setup.html)

If you are looking to get started with Git and GitHub, we recommend you register for the "What they forgot to teach you about R" workshop on Day 1, and join us for this workshop on Day 2.
